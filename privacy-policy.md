# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 1st of June, 2025

**Brainrot Simulator: Sahur Go!** ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This policy explains how we handle user data.

## 1. Information We Collect

We **do not collect any personal information** directly through **Brainrot Simulator: Sahur Go!**.

However, we may receive **aggregated and anonymized analytics** data from **Google Play Console**, such as:

- Device type and operating system version  
- Country or region  
- App crashes or technical performance  
- Install and uninstall statistics  
- General engagement metrics (e.g., number of users)

This data is used only to improve app performance and user experience.

## 2. Advertising and Third-Party Services

**Brainrot Simulator: Sahur Go!** displays ads provided by **Google AdMob**. These ads may be personalized based on your interests and may involve the collection of certain data such as, but not limited to:

- Device information (e.g., device type, OS, language)  
- Advertising identifiers (e.g., GAID on Android)  
- Approximate location (based on IP address)  
- Interactions with ads (e.g., views, clicks)

We use **Google's Consent Management Platform (CMP)** to manage user consent in accordance with applicable privacy regulations (such as the GDPR). You may be asked to provide or manage your consent when using the app.

You can manage your preferences regarding personalized advertising at any time through the consent prompt shown in the app or by visiting [Googleâ€™s Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com). Choosing to opt out of personalized ads does not remove ads but may result in less relevant advertising.

The app does not request access to storage, contacts, camera, or other sensitive permissions.

## 4. Data Retention

We do not store or retain any personal data from users of **Brainrot Simulator: Sahur Go!**. Aggregated analytics data provided by third-party platforms (e.g., Google Play Console) is retained according to their respective policies and is not personally identifiable.

## 5. Data Security
